  "granite3.3:8b|what ai": "AI, or artificial intelligence, refers to the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems. These processes include learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and language understanding. AI can be categorized as either weak (designed to perform a narrow task like voice recognition) or strong (theoretically capable of performing any intellectual task that a human can).",
  "granite3.3:8b|explain ai": "AI, or Artificial Intelligence, refers to the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems. These processes include learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and language understanding. AI can be categorized into two main types: Narrow AI, which is designed to perform a narrow task (like facial recognition or internet searches), and General AI, which can perform any intellectual task that a human being can do. AI systems use algorithms and often large datasets to learn patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention.",

These processes include learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and language understanding. AI can be categorized as either weak (designed to perform a narrow task like voice recognition) or strong (theoretically able to perform any intellectual task that a human can). It's a multidisciplinary field involving various areas such as computer science, mathematics, psychology, and linguistics."
